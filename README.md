# HUMID - Simple Experiment with a Humidity Sensor

... *also known as*: 💾 **the Depths of Eruanno's Hard Drive** 💾.

Simple project for Raspberry Pi made for fun.

Humidity sensor (DHT11 or similar) and LCD character displaying... well
humidity. In short, boooooring stuff...

No more specs because I am lazy. And I don't care 🤷‍♂️.

Probably the only interesting part are custom glyphs for displaying large
digits.
